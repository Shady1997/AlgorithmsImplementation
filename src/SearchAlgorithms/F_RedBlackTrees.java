    //A red-black tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree that guarantees a height of O(log(n)) for a tree containing n nodes. It is called a "red-black" tree because each node is either colored red or black.
    //
    //Red-black trees are used to implement map and set data structures in the Java Standard Library. They offer O(log(n)) time complexity for operations such as search, insert, and delete, which makes them more efficient than other self-balancing binary search trees, such as AVL trees.
    //
    //To use a red-black tree in Java, you can use the java.util.TreeMap class, which implements the java.util.Map interface using a red-black tree.
    //
    //Here is an example of how you might use TreeMap to create a map that stores mappings from strings to integers:
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // Create a tree map
            TreeMap<String, Integer> map = new TreeMap<>();

            // Add some mappings to the map
            map.put("apple", 1);
            map.put("banana", 2);
            map.put("cherry", 3);

            // Get the value for a key
            int value = map.get("banana");
            System.out.println(value); // Outputs 2

            // Remove a mapping from the map
            map.remove("cherry");

            // Print the map
            System.out.println(map); // Outputs {apple=1, banana=2}
        }
        //This code creates a tree map and adds three mappings to it: "apple" maps to 1, "banana" maps to 2, and "cherry" maps to 3. It then retrieves the value for the key "banana" (which is 2) and removes the mapping for "cherry". Finally, it prints the map, which will output {apple=1, banana=2}.
    //
    //You can also use the java.util.TreeSet class, which implements the java.util.Set interface using a red-black tree, to create a set that stores unique elements in sorted order.
